# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Documentation Maintenance Required

## 🚨 Critical Rule for All Developers and AI Assistants

**WHENEVER YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE CODEBASE, YOU MUST UPDATE THE CORRESPONDING DOCUMENTATION FILES IN THIS FOLDER.**

---

## 📚 What's in This Folder?

This `docs/` folder contains **5 AI-friendly documentation files** that provide a complete overview of the OmniStock project for AI assistants (Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.):

1. **AI_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - Business context, architecture, features
2. **AI_TECH_STACK.md** - Technology stack, versions, dependencies
3. **AI_DATABASE_GUIDE.md** - Database schema, 43 tables, relationships
4. **AI_API_REFERENCE.md** - REST API endpoints (23 total)
5. **AI_CODE_CONVENTIONS.md** - Coding standards, best practices

---

## ⚠️ Why This Matters

These documentation files are specifically designed for AI assistants to:
- Quickly understand the entire project
- Make accurate code changes
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Avoid breaking existing functionality

**If the documentation is outdated, AI assistants will make incorrect assumptions and introduce bugs.**

## 📖 How to Update

1. **Read `docs/README.md`** - Complete maintenance guide
2. **Identify affected files** - See table above
3. **Update relevant sections** - Keep it accurate and comprehensive
4. **Update version number** - Increment version at top of file
5. **Update "Last Updated" date** - Change to current date
6. **Include in your PR** - Documentation updates should be part of the same PR as code changes

## ✅ Before Merging Your PR

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Did I change any features, APIs, database schema, or dependencies?
- [ ] If yes, did I update the corresponding documentation files?
- [ ] Did I increment the version number and update the date?
- [ ] Are the code examples in the docs still accurate?

**If you answered "no" to any of these, your PR is not ready to merge.**

---

## 🤖 For AI Assistants

When you make changes to the codebase:

1. **ALWAYS** check if documentation needs updating
2. **ALWAYS** update documentation in the same session as code changes
3. **NEVER** skip documentation updates "for later"
4. **ALWAYS** verify your updates are accurate and comprehensive
