## 📋 Next Steps

### **1. Add Issues to "Omni Master Roadmap" Project**

⚠️ **Manual Action Required:** GitHub CLI doesn't fully support adding issues to Projects v2 yet.

**Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/users/hndao/projects/8
2. Click "+ Add item"
3. Search for issues #2-#20
4. Add them to the project board

**Option 2: Bulk Add**
1. Go to the project board
2. Use the "Add items" feature
3. Filter by repository: `hndao/omni-ecom-nextjs`
4. Select all issues #2-#20
5. Add to project

### **2. Add Labels (Optional)**

You may want to add labels to categorize the issues:

**Suggested Labels:**
- `enhancement` - All issues are enhancements
- `frontend` - All issues are frontend tasks
- `high-priority` - Issues #2, #3, #4, #7, #8, #9, #17

- `low-priority` - Issues #6, #12, #13, #14, #16
- `shopping-experience` - Issues #2-#6
- `customer-account` - Issues #7-#11
- `content-pages` - Issues #12-#17
- `navigation` - Issues #18-#20

**To create labels:**
```bash
cd omni-ecom-nextjs
gh label create "enhancement" --color "a2eeef" --description "New feature or request"
gh label create "frontend" --color "0075ca" --description "Frontend Next.js tasks"
gh label create "high-priority" --color "d73a4a" --description "High priority"
gh label create "medium-priority" --color "fbca04" --description "Medium priority"
gh label create "low-priority" --color "0e8a16" --description "Low priority"
```
